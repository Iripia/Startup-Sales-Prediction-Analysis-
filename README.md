## Project Overview
In this startup sales prediction analysis, I leveraged Olist's comprehensive sales data to provide actionable insights and recommendations to a startup company looking to succeed in the Brazilian e-commerce market. The analysis explored various aspects of sales performance, product attributes, order cancellations, and market trends to guide the startup's strategic decision-making.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Power BI
- Power Query Editor
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Steps Covered
1. Compiling questions to be answered
2. Data modeling of 9 tables
3. Data cleaning using power query editor
4. Data processing through addition of custom columns
5. Data analysis using dax functions and
6. Data visualization / Dashboard creation using Power Bi

## Scenario Used
A startup company is interested in understanding the factors that contribute to successful sales performance in the Brazilian market so I was expected to analyze the Olist sales data and provide them with actionable insights to guide their business strategy and decision-making.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Three dashboards were made, each a different analysis. Each analysis and the questions answered include:

Market Potential Estimation Analysis:
- What is the total sales revenue (plus shipping) generated, total orders made, and orders canceled?
- Which customer state and city generated the most revenue and had more orders?
- Customer feedback - What are the total orders gotten per review score?
Product Performance Analysis and Order Cancellation Analysis:
- Do products with longer description lengths sell more?
- Do products with more photos sell more?
- What product category sells more and which has more orders?
- For orders that are canceled, what factors do they have in common?
- People with what payment type are likely to cancel orders?
- Identify the most common number of installments and their impact on the overall sales.

  
Yearly Trend and Sales Forecast Analysis:
- What is the total revenue made by year? And identify the growth rate between these years.
- Analyze the growth of sellers.
- Sales prediction for the next 10 years.
